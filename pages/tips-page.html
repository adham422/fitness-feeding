                <h1 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The most important tips</h1>
                <h3>1. Eat a healthy breakfast</h3>
                <p>
                    If you exercise in the morning, wake up early enough to eat breakfast
                    at least one hour before starting your workout. Eat well when you go
                    to exercise. Studies show that eating or drinking carbohydrates before
                    exercise can improve exercise performance and may allow you to exercise
                    longer or at a higher intensity.If you don't eat, you may feel sluggish
                    or dizzy when you exercise.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2. Watch the serving size</h3>
                <p>
                    Be careful not to exaggerate the amount of food you eat before exercising. The general guidelines
                    indicate:Big meals. Eat these meals at least 3 to 4 hours before exercising.
                    Small meals or snacks between meals. Eat these meals at least one hour to three hours before
                    exercising.
                    Eating too much before exercising may make you feel lethargic. Also, eating very small amounts of
                    food
                    may
                    not give you the energy you need to feel strong during exercise.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3. Eat good snacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Most people can eat light foods between meals right before and during exercise. It depends on how
                    you
                    feel. Do what you see fit. Between-meal snacks eaten shortly before exercise won't give you extra
                    energy
                    if your workout lasts less than 60 minutes, but they may prevent distracting hunger pangs. If your
                    workout is longer than 60 minutes, you may benefit from adding carbohydrate-rich food or drinks
                    during
                    your workout. Good snack options include:
                    Energy bars
                    / A banana, apple, or other fresh fruit
                    / Yogurt
                    / Whipped fruit drink
                    / Whole wheat bread or crackers
                    / Low-fat granola bar
                    / Peanut butter sandwich
                    / Sports drink or diluted juice
                    It's important to eat a healthy snack, especially if you plan to exercise several hours after a main
                    meal.

                <h3>4. Eat after finishing exercises</h3>
                <p>
                    To help your muscles recover and replenish lost glycogen stores, eat a meal containing
                    carbohydrates and protein within two hours of finishing your workout if possible. Be sure to eat
                    a light meal if your main meal is more than two hours away. Foods that can be a good choice after
                    exercise include:Yogurt and fruit Peanut butter sandwich
                    Low-fat chocolate milk and pretzels (rings or pretzel sticks)
                    Smoothie for post-workout recovery
                    Turkey meat with whole grain bread and vegetables
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>5. Drink</h3>
                <p>
                    Don't forget to drink fluids. You need enough fluids before and after exercise to help prevent
                    dehydration.
                    To stay adequately hydrated for exercise, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends:
                    Drink approximately 2 to 3 cups (473 to 710 milliliters) of water 2 to 3 hours before exercise.
                    Drink about 1/2 to 1 cup (118 to 237 milliliters) of water every 15 to 20 minutes during exercise.
                    Adjust the amount depending on your body size and weather.
                    Drink approximately 2 to 3 cups (473 to 710 milliliters) of water after exercise for every pound
                    (0.5
                    kg) of weight you lose during exercise.
                    Water is generally the best way to replace lost fluids. But if you exercise for more than 60
                    minutes,
                    drink a sports drink. Sports drinks may help maintain your body's electrolyte balance and give you
                    more
                    energy because they contain carbohydrates.

                    <span>After exercise, it is preferable for a person’s diet to be characterized by the
                        following:</span>
